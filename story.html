			<h1 class="text-container-header">OUR STORY</h1>
			<p>In 1961 Jack Belcher bought a boat and then looked for somewhere suitable to launch. He and his son Barry checked the foreshore of the Mangere Bridge area. After looking at several spots they settled on the area beside the shelly beach on Kiwi Esplanade. This was small bay with a beach of singles leading out ot mud. On attempting to launch, the vehicle was sunk to its axles, with the boat and trailer plus the tow truck that had tried to pull them out, only to finally rescued by tractor. </p>
			<p>Mangere Bridge was a country town at that stage and the chairman was Harry Short of H.J. Short Cosntruction. Harry and Jack Belcher were both members of the Onehunga Rotary Club at the time, so Jack approached Harry for advice regarding getting a boat ramp built. He suggested they call a meeting so Jack with the assistance of Syd Chambers canvassed the area for all possible prospective boaties to form a club. The response was great.</p>
			<p>November 1961, a weel attended meeting was held on the foreshore. A steering committee was formed with Jack Belcher as acting chairman and Les Hill as acting secretary.</p>
			<p>The early vision was to gather local knowledge, increase safety awareness of the area, to give fisher-folk an opportunity to share ideas and techniques and finally to provide an arena for friendly competition and camaraderie.</p>
			<p>Over the past many years, the Club has gone through many extensions. It started as a small garage/shed and increasing in size. In 1998/9 it over doubled its size from its present size to what you see today, while remaining operational.</p>
